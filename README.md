Every year I play Fantasy Football on Yahoo Sports and every year I want to gouge my eyes out looking at all their daily fantasy, and fantasy shop, and "CARCOMPANY BEST TEAM OF THE WEEK!" content.

Many users use uBlock Orgin or another element/ad blocker but often times they fail due to one reason or another. To solve the issue I took to using TamperMonkey to modify the UI via JavaScript to get it a little more tolerable for my eyes.

Here is this year's version. 

You can install the user script for tamper monkey by navigating here: https://openuserjs.org/scripts/the_umm_guy/deCrapifyYahoo2018

Or, if you know how, do it manually.

Follow these instructions for installing if you have any issues: https://openuserjs.org/about/Userscript-Beginners-HOWTO

If you don't have TamperMonkey and need to learn how to install it: https://openuserjs.org/about/Tampermonkey-for-Chrome

Please let me know if you have any issues or suggestions!

Good luck this season!
